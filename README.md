# Intelligent Briscola player
In this project @giuseppefrn and I created an AI able to play the "Briscola" card game against a human (or against another AI).

The project is written in C#.

The Artificial Intelligence was trained using Decisional Threes.

## How to play

1) Start the server (the referee) typing: `node server.js`

2) Start the AI client by opening the `clientTCP` project file inside **AI_Player_client** folder with VisualStudio

3) Start the human client [or another AI] opening the `clientTCP` project file inside **Human_Player_client** [**AI_Player_client**] folder with VisualStudio
